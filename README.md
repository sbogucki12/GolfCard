# GolfCard


## Summary

App for golfers.  It's a virtual scorecard that allows golfers to record and save their golf scores as they play. Views optimized for mobile (though not a native mobile app).  

## Background

I really like the technology stack that we use at work.  So, I wanted to build something with some of those same technologies.  At work, we use: 

+ C#
+ Redis
+ SignalR
+ ODATA 
+ .NET Web API
+ .NET MVC
+ React 
+ Redux
+ TypeScript

This app, **GolfCard**, won't be quite so ambitious.  Its technology stack will be: 

+ C#
+ SQL Server Express
+ Entity Framework
+ LINQ (Maybe ODATA, if appropriate)
+ .NET Web API
+ NET MVC (home View will be root for the React App)
+ React
+ Redux
+ TypeScript

I *REALLY* enjoy using TypeScript with React!!! 


## Upcoming To-Dos 

[ ] - Exception Handling in the Web APi Controller 

[ ] - Scaffold out React/Redux app using Create React App with TypeScript 



## Timeline

**Day One (April 7, 2018)** 

+ Created data model
+ Created Web API
+ Created Controllers for Starting a Golf Round, Adding Hole Score, Getting a Golf Round
+ Created SQL Server Express Database

~~ISO FTE dev position in the Los Angeles area. Would consider relocation, but only to Minneapolis (weird, I know, but I grew up in the area).~~  

My strength is C# fundamentals, .NET MVC and Web API, including all related technology: Entity Framework, SQL Server, LINQ etc.  I've deployed apps to Azure, Heroku, and AWS with Angular and AngularJS front-ends, but I intend to relearn vanilla JavaScript from the ground-up, just as I have C#.  

I've only recently been digging into React and TypeScript and enjoy them individually but LOVE them together.  Still making sense of Redux :)
